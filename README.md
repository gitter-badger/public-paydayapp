# public-paydayapp
This repository is intended to develop and share in the production of an ES6 application that everyone can benefit from chrome or node. Free use of code assets for not-for-profit developments and licensing will need to be researched today to include a final deployable in the case we can get paid delivering something as a team (or individually if alone) to the public, and to grow new abilities for projects that benefit humanity in the real world. Support is initially intended for US_en however it will be enjoyable learning what sort of internationalization goes into this.
